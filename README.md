# XML Reader
In this Code data is extracted from xml files. The code in this repository shows how to extract data from one file when there are different varieties how the path
could be named. This is used because the code was used in a bigger loop (not created by me) to go through many xml files with data from many years, which
used different labels sometimes for the same data.
Still this code gives insight how to easily use xpaths in pyhton to gather data, if it is xml or html.

## Learning
During this project it seemed to me that other methods and libraries were inferior when it comes to maneuvering throung xml or html.
